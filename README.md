# Stock Market Algo Trading Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements an **algorithmic trading system** that leverages **machine learning models** to predict stock price movements and execute trades based on historical market data. The system is designed to optimize trading strategies by analyzing market trends, price patterns, and technical indicators.  

Additionally, the project integrates **Generative AI** to analyze **market news sentiment** and provide **conversational insights** into a personal investment portfolio. This enables traders to make more informed decisions based on both structured market data and unstructured financial news.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms stock market data for model training.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Uses technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD) for predictive insights.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, or Transformer-based models.  
- **Backtesting**: Simulates trades on historical data to evaluate strategy performance.  
- **Live Trading**: Integrates with brokerage APIs to execute trades in real-time.  
- **Risk Management**: Includes stop-loss, take-profit, and position-sizing mechanisms.  
- **Generative AI for Market News Analysis**: Analyzes financial news sentiment to assess its potential impact on stock prices.  
- **AI-Powered Portfolio Chatbot**: Allows users to interact with their investment portfolio through natural language queries, enabling real-time insights and recommendations.  

With the **addition of Generative AI**, this system goes beyond traditional algorithmic trading by incorporating real-time **news sentiment** and **personalized AI-driven portfolio insights**, enhancing decision-making for traders. 🚀.

## 📊 Data Sources
The model uses stock price data from sources like:
- **Yahoo Finance** (`yfinance` API)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Model
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   ```bash
   python src/data_processing.py
   ```
2. **Model Training**
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```
3. **Backtesting the Strategy**
   ```bash
   python src/backtesting.py
   ```
4. **Live Trading** (Ensure API keys are configured)
   ```bash
   python src/live_trading.py
   ```

## 📈 Trading Strategies Implemented
- **Momentum Trading**: Uses moving averages and RSI to identify trends.
- **Mean Reversion**: Detects overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Breakout Strategy**: Trades based on support/resistance breakouts.
- **Machine Learning-Based Predictions**: Uses historical price data and indicators for buy/sell decisions.

## 🛡️ Risk Management
- **Stop-Loss & Take-Profit**: Dynamically adjusts risk per trade.
- **Position Sizing**: Adjusts trade sizes based on portfolio size.
- **Diversification**: Limits exposure to a single asset class.

## 🔗 API & Brokerage Integration
- **Alpaca API**: For commission-free trading
- **Interactive Brokers API**: For institutional-grade trading
- **Binance API**: For cryptocurrency trading

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for research and analysis)
- **Backtrader** (for strategy backtesting)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (for deploying as a trading service)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- ✅ Reinforcement Learning for adaptive trading
- ✅ Integration with more real-time data sources
- ✅ Enhanced deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformer-based models)
- ✅ Web dashboard for real-time strategy monitoring
