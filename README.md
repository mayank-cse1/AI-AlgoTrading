# Stock Market Algo Trading Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **algorithmic trading system** that leverages **machine learning models** to predict stock price movements and execute trades based on historical market data. The system is designed to optimize trading strategies by analyzing market trends, price patterns, and technical indicators.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms stock market data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Uses technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD) for predictive insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, or Transformer-based models.
- **Backtesting**: Simulates trades on historical data to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Live Trading**: Integrates with brokerage APIs to execute trades in real-time.
- **Risk Management**: Includes stop-loss, take-profit, and position-sizing mechanisms.

## 📊 Data Sources
The model uses stock price data from sources like:
- **Yahoo Finance** (`yfinance` API)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Model
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   ```bash
   python src/data_processing.py
   ```
2. **Model Training**
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```
3. **Backtesting the Strategy**
   ```bash
   python src/backtesting.py
   ```
4. **Live Trading** (Ensure API keys are configured)
   ```bash
   python src/live_trading.py
   ```

## 📈 Trading Strategies Implemented
- **Momentum Trading**: Uses moving averages and RSI to identify trends.
- **Mean Reversion**: Detects overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Breakout Strategy**: Trades based on support/resistance breakouts.
- **Machine Learning-Based Predictions**: Uses historical price data and indicators for buy/sell decisions.

## 🛡️ Risk Management
- **Stop-Loss & Take-Profit**: Dynamically adjusts risk per trade.
- **Position Sizing**: Adjusts trade sizes based on portfolio size.
- **Diversification**: Limits exposure to a single asset class.

## 🔗 API & Brokerage Integration
- **Alpaca API**: For commission-free trading
- **Interactive Brokers API**: For institutional-grade trading
- **Binance API**: For cryptocurrency trading

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for research and analysis)
- **Backtrader** (for strategy backtesting)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (for deploying as a trading service)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- ✅ Reinforcement Learning for adaptive trading
- ✅ Integration with more real-time data sources
- ✅ Enhanced deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformer-based models)
- ✅ Web dashboard for real-time strategy monitoring
